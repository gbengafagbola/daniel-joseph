                I live in a space driven by curiosity. Design is a go-to to save the world. So, I've got superpowers. <br />
                I have a Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry Education and a Background in Branding & Data Analysis. I was previously at eSoft Response where I took the role of a Creative Lead while still functioning as the UI/UX Designer and I‚Äôm presently with Yokunbo Studios. Also, Co-Founding an eCommerce Store (WIP) and Tribal Play. <br />
                When I‚Äôm not learning or saving the world with my super powers, I enjoy playing video games and taking a walk to appreciate nature. <br />
                I would love to have a TV show of my own to give back to the community by empowering through resources, knowledge and entertainment.
