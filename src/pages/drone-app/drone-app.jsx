                Drone for example can be used in different industry and in this case study, drone was used in aiding precision farming to improve data gathering and analysis. 
                This project was submitted to the Department of Elect./Elect. (Computer Option) in the University of Port Harcourt, Choba, Nigeria.</div>

            <div className='the-content-low'>Based on assumptions, I formulated questions for a remote online survey that was answered by 28 people (all were farmers) within 5 days. 
                The survey helped us understand what some of the people problem was and how we can meet people at their human needs. 
                Here are some of the response;

            <div className='the-content-low'>With our research findings and personas in mind, I invited Gbenga, Obuso and Nonso to brainstorm solutions together on an online remote and physical session.

            <div className='the-content'>We already had our assumptions and provided some screens based on the feedbacks we had, I advocated conducting user interviews to understand to what extent the solution was effective. I also encouraged Gbenga, Obuso and Nonso to take part in the process to empathize with our users and learn how they interact with the app step by step. We interviewed ten (10) people in Nigeria (20% physically and 80% in an online remote session) from different locations with various farm crop type and products.</div>
